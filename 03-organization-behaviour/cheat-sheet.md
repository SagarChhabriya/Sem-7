# Chapter 5: Personality and Values


1. Personality
    - The sum total of ways in which an individual reacts and interacts with others, the measurable traits a person exhibits

2. Personality Determinants
    - Heredity: Genes are the source (supported by Twin Studies). Physical stature, temperament, bio-rhythms determined at conception.
    - Environment: Parents add little much to personality development; however, personality can change over long periods.
    
    - Measuring:
        - Self-reporting surveys: Most common but prone to bias.
        - Observer-ratings: Independent assessment, often better predictors.

✨ 3. Personality trait frameworks
    - Personality Trait: Long-term characteristics that describe an individual’s behavior

4. MBTI and Big Five Model
    - MBTI: Classifies people on 4 axes into 16 types (e.g., ENTJ, INTJ).
    - Use: Good for self-awareness/counseling. BAD for job selection.
    - Examples:
        - Visionaries (INTJ): Original, stubborn.
        - Organizers (ESTJ): Realistic, logical.
        - Conceptualizers (ENTP): Entrepreneurial.

    - Big Five Model (OCEAN)
        - Extroversion: Sociable, assertive. (Happy in jobs, good social skills).
        - Agreeableness: Cooperative, trusting. (Good in social settings).
        - Conscientiousness: Responsible, organized. (Strongest predictor of high job performance).
        - Emotional Stability: Calm vs. Neurotic/Insecure. (Related to job satisfaction).
        - Openness to Experience: Curious, artistic. (Creative, good leaders).

3. Other OB-Relevant Traits | CR-PM-NTS

* **C** = **Core Self-Evaluation**: Like yourself → Better performance
* **M** = **Machiavellianism**: "Ends justify the means" → Manipulative, good in direct interaction
* **N** = **Narcissism**: Arrogant, needs admiration → Less effective workers
* **S** = **Self-Monitoring**: Adjust behavior → High monitors = Better leaders
* **R** = **Risk-Taking**: Willing to take chances → Faster decisions with less info
* **T** = **Type A Personality**: Achieve more → Impatient, obsessed with numbers
* **P** = **Proactive Personality**: Takes initiative, creates change → Perseveres

7. Values: “How To” live life properly.
    - Attributes: Content (what is important) + Intensity (how important).
    - Rokeach Value Survey:
        - Terminal Values: Desired end-states (Goals for lifetime).
        - Instrumental Values: Preferred modes of behavior (Means to achieve goals).

9. Generational Values: Verterans, Boomers, Xers, Nexters

10. Linking Personality and Values to the Workplace | Matching People to Jobs

    - Person-Job Fit (Holland): 6 Types (Realistic, Investigative, Social, Conventional, Enterprising, Artistic). Satisfaction is highest when personality matches occupation.

    - Person-Organization Fit: Personality must fit culture (e.g., Big Five matching values). Mismatch = Turnover.

    - Holland's Topology: I-RACES
        - Investigative: Prefer physical activities that require skills and strength
        - Realistic: prefer activities that require thinking
        - Artistic: perfer activities that require creativity
        - Conventional: prefer unambigous activites
        - Enterprising: prefer verbal activites to influence others
        - Social: prefer activities that involve helping others

✨ 11. Hofseted's cultural Framework: IMPUT
    Hofstede's Framework is a model that identifies six dimensions of cultural differences that influence behaviors in the workplace. These dimensions help explain how people from different cultures may act, think, or respond to situations in various organizational settings.

    - Individualism vs Collectivism: prioritzing on personal vs. group goals.
    - Masculanity vs Femininity: Preference for achievement vs. quality of life.
    - Power Distance: How much inequality in power is accepted. (High = accepts hierarchy; Low = equality).
    - Uncertainity Avoidance: Comfort with uncertainty and change.
    - Time Orientation: Focus on Long-term vs Short-term results

# Chapter 6: Perception and Decision Making

1. The process of interpreting and organizing sensory impression to give meaning to the environment.
2. Key factors: Perciever(Attitude, experience, etc); The Target (Motion, novelty), The siutation(time, work/social setting)

✨ 3. Attribution theory (Judging others): Determining if behavior is Internally caused (under personal control) or Externally caused (forced by situation).

3 determinants: (DCC) 
    - Distinctiveness: Different behavior in different situations? (High = External).
    - Consensus: Do others respond the same way? (High = External)
    - Consistency: Does this person always do this? (High = Internal).

Attribution errors:
    - Fundamental Attribution Error
        - Underestimating external factors and overestimating internal factors when judging others (We blame the person, not the situation).
    - Self-serving bias
        - Attributing own success to internal factors and own failure to external factors.

✨ 4. Shortcuts in judging others: (SHCS)
    - Selective Perception: Only noticing things that fit with your own interests or background.
    - Halo Effect: Making a general judgment about someone based on one thing you like about them
    - Contrast Effect: Judging someone based on how they compare to others you’ve recently seen,
    - Stereotyping: Making assumptions about someone based on the group they belong to
        - Profiling: Focusing on one group (often based on race) and treating them differently because of it.

5. Organization Applications: Interview, Expectations(Self-fulfilling Prophecy: Teachers expectations), Evaluations

✨ 7. Decision Making Models
    - Rational Model (Perfect World): Maximum Benefit laptop and car example
    - Bounded Rationality (Good enough): Don't have enough time or experience and you need a good enough rather perfect
    - Intuition (Gut Feeling Approach): Emma wasn’t thinking logically about all the data—she just had a strong feeling, based on her past experiences

8. Common Decision Biases: 
    - Overconfidence: Jake thought he knew it all about investing, but he didn’t.
    - Confirmation Bias (Seeking only supporting facts): teve ignored evidence that contradicted his diet.
    - Availability Bias: Maya feared flying because of recent news about plane crashes.
    - Escalation of Commitment (Sticking to a bad decision): Mark kept investing in his failing restaurant.
    - Randomness Error: Lucy thought her lucky pen determined her success in meetings.
    - Winner’s Curse (Overpaying at auctions): Tom overpaid for an item at an auction because he was determined to win.

9. Individual differences in decision making and organizational constraints
    - Personality: Conscientiousness, Self-Esteem
    - Gender
    - Organizationl Constraints:
        - Performance Evaluations, Reward Systems, Formal Regulations, Time Constraints, Historical Precedents.

✨ 10. Ethics in Decision Making
    
    - Utilitarianism: Greatest good for greatest number. (Pro: Efficiency / Con: Ignores minority rights).
        - best decision is the one that creates the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people.
    - Rights: Respecting fundamental liberties (e.g., whistleblowers). (Pro: Protects individuals / Con: Legalistic).
    - Justice: Fair/impartial enforcement. (Pro: Protects weak / Con: Entitlement).
    - Global Ethics: No global standard. Asian countries view ethics as "shades of gray," not black/white.

# Chapter 7: Motivational Concepts

1. Motivation: Motivation is the process that explains how hard you try, where you focus your effort, and how long you keep going toward a goal.
    - Intensity, Direction and Persistence

2. Early Theories
    - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory: PSSES
        - The Rule: You must satisfy lower needs before moving up.Order: 
        - Physiological → Safety → Social → Esteem → Self-Actualization.
        - Alderfer’s ERG Theory (The Upgrade)
            - No rigid hierarchy; you can work on all three at once.
                - Existence(Physiological and Safety), Relatedness(Social), Growth(Esteem, Self-Actualization)
    - McGregor’s(muh-Greg) Theory X and Theory Y
        - Theory X (Negative): Managers assume employees hate work and need coercion.
        - Theory Y (Positive): Managers assume employees like work and seek responsibility.
    - Herzberg’s Two-Factor  Theory
        - Hygiene Factors: (Pay, Policies, Conditions).
            - If bad → Dissatisfaction.
            - If good → No Dissatisfaction (Neutral). These do NOT motivate.
        - Motivators: (Growth, Recognition, Responsibility).
            - These create true Satisfaction.
    - McClelland’s (mklend) Theory of Needs
        - nAch (Achievement) |Maslow's Esteem : Drive to excel. Prefers 50/50 risk (not gambling, but not too easy).
        - nPow (Power) | Maslow's Self-Actualization: Need to control others.
        - nAff (Affiliation) | Maslow's Social(Love & Belongingness): Need for friendship.
        - Exam Note: Best managers usually have high nPow and low nAff.


✨ 3. Contemporary Theories (The Current Science) | SCLB
    
    1. Self-Determination: Doing what you enjoy 
    2. Cognitive Evaluation Theory
        -The Trap: Giving extrinsic rewards (money) for behavior that was previously intrinsic (fun) reduces motivation.
        - Lesson: Verbal rewards increase intrinsic motivation; money often hurts it.
        - Building on this, Cognitive Evaluation Theory suggests that when you provide external rewards (e.g., bonuses) for something people already enjoy doing, it lowers their intrinsic motivation


    3. Locke’s Goal-Setting Theory
        - Emma finds out that Goal-Setting Theory argues that specific, challenging goals lead to better performance. The key is that people are motivated by clear goals that are difficult but achievable. If goals are simple or vague, they won’t be motivating.
        - Specific Goals + Difficult Goals + Feedback = Highest Performance. 
        - Management by Objectives (MBO): Converting overall company goals into specific objectives for employees. Goals must be Tangible, Verifiable, and Measurable.
        

    4. Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory
        - Next, Emma explores Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory, which states that people’s belief in their ability to succeed influences their motivation. When employees believe they can succeed (high self-efficacy), they are more motivated to achieve the goal.
        - An individual's belief that they are capable of performing a task. (Confidence)

    5.  Reinforcement Theory
        - Emma also learns about Reinforcement Theory, which involves rewarding positive behavior and punishing negative behavior to encourage or discourage certain actions. She realizes that positive reinforcement (like praise or rewards) is more effective than punishment in motivating her team.

    6. Equity Theory (Organizational Justice)
        - Employees compare their Input/Output ratio to "Relevant Others."
        - If Ratio is unequal → Inequity Tension → Employee quits or reduces effort.
    
    7. Expectancy Theory (Vroom) ✨
        - Motivation depends on three links:
            1. Effort-Performance: "If I try, will I succeed?"
            2. Performance-Reward: "If I succeed, will I get a reward?"
            3. Reward-Personal Goal: "Is the reward something I actually want?"
        - Lastly, Emma discovers Vroom’s Expectancy Theory, which is about expectancy—the belief that effort will lead to performance, and instrumentality—the belief that good performance will lead to rewards. If employees don’t believe their efforts will be rewarded, they won’t be motivated.

# Motivation Concepts to Applications

1. Define motivation by job design

✨ 2. What is JCM & MPS
    - Job Characteristics Model (JCM)
        - Hackman and Oldham: Any job can be described by 5 dimensions
        - Skill Variety
        - Task Identity
        - Task Significance
        - Autonomy
        - Feedback

        - MPS: Motivating Potential Score

✨ 3. How can job be redesigned
    - Job Rotation: occasionally shifting team members from one task to another to increase their skill variety.
    - Job Enlargement: Broadening job responsibilities to make the work more interesting and less repetitive.
    - Job Enrichment: Giving team members more autonomy and responsibility
4. Guidelines for Enriching a Job

5. Alternative work Arrangments
    - Flextime, Job Sharing, Telecommuting(working from home)
        - Pros: Larger labor pool, productivity, morale.
        - Cons: Less supervision, feelings of isolation.


✨ 6. Employee involvment and types of employee involvement programs
    - Participative Management: Subordinates share decision-making power.
        - Sarah invites her team to share in decision-making about the projects they work on. This boosts their sense of ownership and responsibility.
    - Representative Participation: Workers councils or board representatives (common in Europe).
        - She considers setting up a quality circle where employees meet regularly to suggest improvements, solve problems, and discuss work-related issues.

✨ 7. Four Major Strategic Reward Decision
    1. What to pay  
        - Internal Equity: how fair the pay is within the organization
        - External Equity: how competitive the pay is with the market
        - Pay leaders
    2. How to pay
        - Variable Pay programs: 
            - Price Rate: Pay employees based on units produced (though not feasible for all tasks).
            - Merit Based: Salary increases based on performance reviews.
            - Bonuses: Rewarding recent accomplishments with performance-based bonuses.

        - Skill Based programs: Profit Sharing, Gain Sharing, Employee Stock Ownership Options

    3. What benefits to offer
        - Sarah introduces a flexible benefits program that allows her team to choose their benefits based on their needs. This approach helps her employees feel valued and gives them the power to choose what works best for them.
            - Modular Plans: Predesigned benefit packages.
            - Core-Plus Plans: A core set of essential benefits, with options to add more.
            - Flexible Spending Plans: Employees can use tax-free dollars for specific benefits.

    4. How to build recognition programs
        - Sarah knows that recognition is an important motivator. She introduces intrinsic rewards like personal attention, appreciation for hard work, and public recognition at team meetings. These simple, low-cost initiatives go a long way in improving morale and performance.


# Organization Change and Stress Management

1. Forces for change
    - Nature of Workforce
    - Economic
    - Political
    - Technological
    - Social
    - Competition

2. Planned Change
    - Change: Making things different
    - Planned Change: Proactive and goal oriented approach
    - Change Agents: individuals who acts as catalysts for change

✨ 3. Resistence to change and sources of resistence to change
    - Resistance to change is a natural response to the uncertainty that change often brings. People don’t like to feel uncertain or uncomfortable, so they may resist even if the change is for the better.

    - Over resistence
        - Definition: Resistance that is visible and direct, like complaints or strikes. This type of resistance is loud and clear.
        - Example: Employees openly protest when a new rule is implemented, or they voice complaints in meetings.

    - Implicit resistence
        - Definition: Subtle or indirect resistance, like withdrawing, demotivation, or decline in productivity, which isn’t always immediately obvious.
        - Example: An employee might stop working as efficiently after a new management style is introduced but won’t openly admit to resisting it.

    - Deferred resistence
        - Definition: Resistance that isn’t shown right away. It can surface much later as frustration or lack of motivation.
        - Example: A team agrees to a new process in a meeting, but a few months later, they start making more errors, and productivity drops. The initial resistance wasn’t visible but is now showing up.

    Sources of Resistance to Change:
        - Individual Factors – Fear of the unknown, habit, insecurity.
        - Organizational Factors – Lack of trust, company culture.
        - Change Agent’s Actions – Poor communication or ineffective leadership.

✨ 4. Tactics for overcoming to Resistence to change
    - Education and Communication – Explaining the change clearly.
    - Participation – Involving employees in the change process.
    - Building Support and Commitment – Providing training, counseling, or support.
    - Coercion – Using threats or force (as a last resort).
    - Manipulation and Cooptation – Offering incentives or "spinning" the change message.

5. The politics of change
    - Internal vs. External Change Agents – The difference between managers and external consultants.
    - Power and Change – How power dynamics affect the pace and nature of change in an organization.
    - Incremental vs. Radical Change – The scale of change and its impact.

✨ 6. Lewin's Three Step model
    - Unfreezing – Breaking the status quo to prepare for change.
    - Changing – Implementing the change itself.
    - Refreezing – Stabilizing the new changes and making them permanent.

✨ 7. Kotter’s Eight-Step Plan: 
    - Unfreezing
        1. Create a sense of urgency.
        2. Form a guiding coalition.
        3. Create a new vision for the change.
        4. Communicate the vision.
    - Movement
        5. Empower action.
        6. Create short-term wins.
        7. Consolidate gains.
    - Refreezing
    8. Reinforce the changes
